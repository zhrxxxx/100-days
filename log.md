### Day 2: January 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: <Br/>
I make a blackjack game that player only able to select level and draw cards infinetly and calculate their score. <Br/>
Future Function: <Br/>
1.compete with program robort [difficulty: Hard] <Br/>
2.<del>improve solo gameplay(3 rounds in total, record the socre player receive) [difficulty: Easy]</del><Br/>
3.more realistic library(cards that has been drawed won't appear again) [difficulty: Normal]<Br/>
4.<del>user interface (player can select another level ir turn off the program after one round) [difficulty: After you make another level]</del><Br/>
5.prettier ui [optional]<Br/>
6.<del>player can choose the value of Ace [difficulty: Normal</del>

### Day 3: January 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: <Br/>
Complete goal 6 (Ace can be 1 or 11 depend on player's total score), now the program can identify whether the card is a number card or a face card. Face cards are all count as 10 rather than 11/12/13.<Br/>
Work on js during class.

### Day 8: January 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: <Br/>
Start working on goal 2: the card that has been draw won't show up again in both player and robot's desk, so player can predict the possiblity more strategically. If the libaray is run out of cards, the program will remind player and player can't draw card infinitely.<Br/>
